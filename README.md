# Quantization-Techniques : Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)

**ADSP 32023 IP01 (Spring 2025) - Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning**

This repository contains a complete Google Colab notebook demonstrating Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) using a custom CNN model on the EuroSAT dataset.These are lecture notes and implementation exercises prepared as part of the Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning course at the University of Chicago (Spring 2025), where I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA).

The notebook walks through:

1. Building and training a baseline CNN model.

2. Applying Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) using TensorFlow Lite.

3. Measuring accuracy, F1 score, inference time, and model size before and after quantization.

4. Visualizing results.

**How to use :**

Open and run the notebook in Google Colab here:
